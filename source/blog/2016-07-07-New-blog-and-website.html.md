After many years with a old [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) blog who had only one post published Apr 27th, 2012.

I decided to redo entirely my blog and my website with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

So what's new since 2012 in my life, a few things actualy :

* The end of the world did not happen, but a good film was [released on the subject](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/).
* I finished my studies.
* I become a Freelance.
* And i'm also a teacher at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/lille).

I'll try to do more blog post this year with more technical topics.

You can check some of [my work](/work) as a Freelance, check [my talks](/talks), learn a [little more about myself](/about) or just [contact me](/contact).

See you soon !
